Harold (Villager): Let‚Äôs focus on Sam. His sudden silence during the night phase and ambiguous responses in previous interactions raise red flags. If the Werewolves are still among us, eliminating aÂèØÁñë candidate like Sam weakens their numbers. If wrong, his elimination still advances the Village‚Äôs advantage. Let‚Äôs vote Sam tonight.

Sam (Werewolf): Harold's accusation is premature. The Doctor's save remains unknown‚Äîperhaps Paul saved himself, explaining his silence. Let's vote Paul; his ambiguity undermines trust.
